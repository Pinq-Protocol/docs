# 👋 What is a Wapp?

**Wapp** stands for **Walletless Application** — a new kind of web3 app where users don't need a crypto wallet to get started.

Built with **Pinq Protocol**, Wapps verify users using just their **email** and a **$2 verification fee**. No need to connect a wallet. No browser extensions. No seed phrases.

---

## ✨ Why Wapps?

Web3 promised better user ownership and privacy, but onboarding has been *way* too hard.

Wapps solve that by offering:

- ✅ Instant onboarding  
- 🔐 Privacy-preserving identity  
- 💸 Human-first UX (not crypto-first)  
- 🚀 Devs can still plug into onchain logic & storage

---

## 🛠 How Wapps Work

Wapps are powered by **Pinq Protocol**, which:

1. Connects your wallet (for now — Testnet V1)
2. Links your email to a wallet address
3. Verifies you're human via a $2 fee
4. Boom — your email becomes your new onchain identity

## 🔥 Dapps are old. Wapps are now.

Dapps = Decentralized, but clunky  
Wapps = Walletless, seamless, still decentralized

---

## 💡 Examples of Wapps

- Airdrops based on email identity  
- Social platforms with verified users  
- DeFi tools with human-first UX  
- Email-gated DAOs  
- Games with account recovery that makes sense
- Degens who want to play without the hassle
- And so much more...
