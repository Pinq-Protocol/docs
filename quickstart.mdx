# ⚡ Quickstart

Welcome to Pinq Protocol — the human-first identity layer for Web3.

This is our **first Testnet version (V1)** — and while we're on the path to a walletless future, you'll still see wallet popups for now (just for this phase 😉).

---

## 🧾 What You'll Need

- A crypto wallet like MetaMask  
- An email address you control  
- $2 for identity verification  
- A curious mind (you're ready 🚀)

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Head to [Pinq Dashboard](https://pinqprotocol.xyz) and click **Connect Wallet**.  
Yes, it'll still trigger a wallet popup — but that's just for now.

---

## 💌 Step 2: Link Your Email

Enter your email after connecting.  
We'll send a link to verify that it's really yours.

---

## 💳 Step 3: Pay $2 to Verify

You'll be asked to pay a small $2 fee to complete the email + wallet verification.  
This helps confirm you own the email and keeps things secure.

---

## 🔐 Step 4: Done!

Congrats! Your wallet and email are now securely linked.  
No more long addresses. No more guesswork.

You've created your **Pinq Identity**.
