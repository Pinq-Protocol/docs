## What is Pinq Protocol?

Pinq Protocol is a human-first, walletless identity layer for Web3. We’re on a mission to replace clunky wallet connections with seamless, intuitive sign-ins that feel like magic — but with the security and power of Web3 underneath.

Whether you're a developer, a founder, or just curious about where identity is heading in Web3 — this is your starting point.

## 🔥 Why Pinq?

- **No wallet? No problem.**  
  Say goodbye to "Connect Wallet" popups. Pinq helps dApps onboard users with what they already have — their identity.

- **Secure, scalable, and walletless.**  
  Built on ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction), using meta accounts to link users' identities without exposing wallet addresses.

- **Designed for devs, loved by users.**  
  Simple SDKs. Fast integration. Happy users. What more could you want?
